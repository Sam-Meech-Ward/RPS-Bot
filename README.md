# 👊✋✌️Rock Paper Scissors Robot

* Connect a paper hand to some chopsticks, ribbon, 3 servos and an arduino uno. As seen on instagram: https://www.instagram.com/p/BusOsIsnmmy/
* Install `StandardFirmataPlus`on the arduino.
* Run the code using `node app.js hand` but replace hand with `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors`.

### Controlled through slack.

For the lecture that this was made for, I hooked it up to slack. 

* Open up slack in the browser.
* Copy the script from `slack.js` into the dev tools console.
* Run `node server.js`
* Have someone send `rock`, `paper`, or `scissors` in the slack channel.
